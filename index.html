  My research is focused on comparative politics, political bahaviour, and political economy in low and high income democracies. Especially, I am interested in how voters evaluate the performance and qualities of politicians, under which conditions politicians transition from clientelistic to programmatic politics, and how this influences political accountability and electoral selection.

  My work employs a causal mixed-method approach: grounded in the potential outcome framework, I use evidence from experimental, observational and qualitative data.

<div id="inheritance" style="display:none;"><br> Much like Brexit, the Greek bailout referendum of 2015 could have been a watershed event that significantly affected the European Economic and Monetary Union and possibly the European Union as a whole. While the referendum did not live up to the hype, the fact remains that the Greek people decided to risk ‘exit’ and reject their international creditors’ bailout terms. In this article, we explore how the cycle of sovereign debt crisis, the externally imposed austerity and the resulting recession affected the outcome of that referendum. We further provide a limited test for the ‘left-behind’ hypothesis, which has been a prominent explanation for recent ‘unexpected’ or ‘surprising’ choices that have been made at the polls. Using municipality data and novel data sources, such as night-time light transmission, we provide aggregate-level support for our expectations.</div>

<b><a href="">The Politics of Implementation: Public Goods Provision and Incumbent Voting.</a></b>
 <i> Working Paper</i> 
<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('misperceptions');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="misperceptions" style="display:none;"><br> A growing literature explores whether voters reward incumbents for programmatic welfare policies. Yet, there is little consensus. This paper proposes that the effect of public goods provision is moderated by the inclusion of politicians in policy implementation and the clarity of their responsibility in the implementation process. When responsibilities during implementation are unclear to voters, incumbents have an incentive to claim credit for actions and outcomes regardless of their actual efforts. When responsibilities are clear, including incumbents can improve accountability and limit underserved credit claiming because voters can verify incumbents efforts. I test the theory in the Philippines, combining the random assignment of a public goods policy with different roles of local politicians during implementation. The results suggest that constituents in treatment municipalities only adjust their voting behavior for incumbents who were involved in implementation. When incumbents' efforts were unobservable, treated constituents reward the incumbent regardless of welfare outcomes. When voters can observe incumbents' efforts during implementation, they reward them according to their efforts and the outcome.</div>

<b><a href="">Do Voters Reward Relief Over Prevention? Evidence from Preferences for Disaster Policies.
</a></b>
<i> Working Paper</i> 
<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('movement');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="movement" style="display:none;"><br> A growing literature suggests that voters reward politicians for disaster relief but not for prevention. Yet, there is little consensus on the mechanisms that underpin this pattern. This paper begins to fill this gap by exploring how voter beliefs and economic losses shape the demand for relief and prevention. I argue that voters are more uncertain about the effectiveness of prevention policies compared to relief policies. Additionally, income losses due to disasters can induce a demand for relief. I test both mechanisms using a survey experiment in Malawi where participants choose between two hypothetical candidates, randomly varying attributes about their prevention and relief policies. I find that voters do value relief efforts over prevention efforts if their effectiveness is uncertain. Once disaster prevention is shown to be effective, voters value it similarly to effective relief policies. However, respondents who suffered economic losses are more likely to prefer candidates who provide effective relief and who used relief cash to buy votes.

  <div id="vaccine" style="display:none;"><br> Survey evidence suggests that vaccination hesitancy is too high in many coun- tries to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of three strategies to increase vaccine uptake, namely, providing freedoms, financial remuneration, and vaccination at local doctors. We use a factorial survey experiment administered to 20,500 online respondents in Ger- many. Our results suggest that all three strategies can increase vaccination uptake on the order of 5 percentage points (PP) among the undecided. The combined effects could be as high as 13 PP for this group. The returns from different strategies vary across age groups, however, with older cohorts more responsive to local access and younger cohorts most responsive to enhanced freedoms for vaccinated citizens.</div>
