  My research is focused on comparative politics, political economy, and political behaviour in low and high income democracies. My research seeks to understand how the distribution of goods and services by government is shaped by voter preferences and beliefs, special interests, and institutions. Especially, I study:
  <ul>
  <li>electoral incentives for public goods provision</li>
  <li>how special interests influence distributive politics</li>
  <li>under what conditions politicians transition from clientelistic to programmatic politics</li>
</ul>
 
 	I use a variety of approaches in my work, including experiments, quantitative analysis of large datasets, and fieldwork.

        Recent evidence suggests that vaccination hesitancy is too high in many countries to sustainably contain COVID-19. Using a factorial survey experiment administered to 20,500 online respondents in Germany, we assess the effectiveness of three strategies to increase vaccine uptake, namely, providing freedoms, financial remuneration, and vaccination at local doctors. Our results suggest that all three strategies can increase vaccination uptake on the order of two to three percentage points (PP) overall and five PP among the undecided. The combined effects could be as high as 13 PP for this group. The returns from different strategies vary across age groups, however, with older cohorts more responsive to local access and younger cohorts most responsive to enhanced freedoms for vaccinated citizens.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Much like Brexit, the Greek bailout referendum of 2015 could have been a watershed event that significantly affected the European Economic and Monetary Union and possibly the European Union as a whole. While the referendum did not live up to the hype, the fact remains that the Greek people decided to risk ‘exit’ and reject their international creditors’ bailout terms. In this article, we explore how the cycle of sovereign debt crisis, the externally imposed austerity and the resulting recession affected the outcome of that referendum. We further provide a limited test for the ‘left-behind’ hypothesis, which has been a prominent explanation for recent ‘unexpected’ or ‘surprising’ choices that have been made at the polls. Using municipality data and novel data sources, such as night-time light transmission, we provide aggregate-level support for our expectations.

<b><a href="http://hartmannfelix.github.io/papers/Hartmann_disaster_preferences.pdf">Do Voters Reward Relief Over Prevention? Evidence from Preferences for Disaster Policies.

<i> Working Paper</i>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Growing evidence suggests that voters reward politicians for disaster relief but not for prevention. Yet, there is little consensus on the mechanisms that underpin this pattern. This paper begins to fill this gap by exploring how voter expectations and income losses shape the demand for relief and prevention. I argue that voters have more pessimistic expectations about the welfare returns from prevention policies compared to relief policies. Additionally, income losses due to disasters can induce a demand for relief. I test both mechanisms using a conjoint experiment in rural Malawi where participants choose between two hypothetical candidates randomly varying attributes about prevention and relief policies. I find that voters do value relief efforts over prevention efforts when outcomes are uncertain. When prevention policies are known to be effective, voters value them similarly to effective relief policies. However, respondents who have suffered economic losses are more likely to reward effective relief.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Major crises regularly lead to a public debate about whether the government should be able to restrict personal freedoms in the interest of public welfare. Using a factorial survey experiment administered to more than 10,000 online survey respondents in Germany during the COVID crisis, we assess under what conditions citizens are willing to sacrifice individual civil freedoms in the interest of public well-being. Despite highly visible protests against Covid policies, we document broad willingness to accept restrictions on rights alongside sharp heterogeneity with respect to vaccination status and party identification. The majority of citizens are vaccinated and strongly support limitations on freedoms in response to extreme conditions-especially when the vaccinated themselves are exempted from these limitations. The unvaccinated minority generally prefer no restrictions on freedoms regardless of the severity of the pandemic. These policy preferences in turn matter for reported trust in government, in opposite ways for vaccinated and unvaccinated citizens.

<b><a href="">The Politics of Implementation: Public Goods Provision and Incumbent Voting.</a></b>
 <i> Working Paper</i> 
</li> 
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
 Do voters in developing democracies reward politicians for public goods provision? The recent literature provides mixed evidence. I argue that the effect of public goods provision on voting is moderated by policy implementation. When politicians are involved and their responsibilities are clear, voters receive a signal regarding how the incumbents’ efforts influence outcomes and, consequently, vote according to performance. When responsibilities are unclear, politicians have an incentive to claim credit regardless of their efforts, and voters are less able to evaluate and punish politicians. They, therefore, vote on the basis of credit claims. I test this theory in the Philippines, leveraging the random assignment of a public goods policy with the different roles of local politicians during implementation. Constituents only adjust their voting behavior for incumbents who were involved in implementation. When incumbents’ efforts are observable, voters reward or punish officials according to efforts and outcomes. When incumbents’ efforts are unobservable, voters reward them regardless of outcomes.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
 As of early 2022 an estimated 50% of the global population is fully vaccinated for COVID-19 but the global distribution of vaccines is extremely unequal, over 85% vaccinated in the top 10 countries and below 3% in the bottom 10. Given that governments need to secure public support for investments in global vaccine sharing, it is important to understand the levels and drivers of public support for international vaccine solidarity. Using a factorial experiment administered to more than 10,000 online survey respondents in Germany, we show that global inequities are out of line with domestic German public opinion. Respondents are supportive of substantive funding amounts, on the order of the most generous contributions provided to date, though still below amounts that are likely needed for a successful global campaign. Public preferences appear largely to be driven by intrinsic concern for the welfare of global populations though are in part explained by material considerations - particularly risks of continued health threats from a failure to vaccinate globally. Strategic considerations are of more limited importance in shaping public opinion; in particular we see no evidence for free riding on contributions by other states. Finally, drawing on an additional survey experiment, we show that there is scope to use information campaigns highlighting international health externalities to augment public support for global campaigns.

<b><a href="">Compromise under Pressure: Electoral Competition, Divided Government and Public Goods Provision.
</a></b>
<i> Working Paper</i> 
&nbsp;
</li> 
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
A growing literature from developing democracies finds that electoral competition can have a negative effect on public service provision. However, the mechanisms are not well understood. I argue that electoral competition leads to divided government, which can amplify electoral incentives for broad programmatic goods and mute incentives for targeted goods. Under divided government, both parties want to distribute goods to different constituencies compared to one constituency under unified government. Thus, parties have the incentive to agree on broad programmatic goods that are distributed to all constituencies, but to disagree on goods that are targeted to specific constituencies. The paper tests the proposition in the Philippines using a novel regression-discontinuity design exploiting the fact that different branches of the local government are elected in separate first-past-the past elections. I show that divided government increased broad welfare transfers and reduced targeted education spending, but only if both politicians faced strong electoral competition.
