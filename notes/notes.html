- ethn. fieldwork: survey -- interview -- participation observation

# 1. Research Design and Acess
- $How=Question+Resources$
- determine what is already fixed -> how
- $Resources$ are time, money, family-movability, but also accessability of the \textit{population} of interest 
- thinking in ethnographic terms makes assumption clear: (1) over time comparisan assumes that the measure at $T_{0}$ measures the same phenomenon at $T_{1}$; (2) also assumes that people perception of the phenomenon is stable from $T_{0}$ to $T_{1}$
- define \textbf{question}, \textbf{potential informants}, and \textbf{actual informants} -> maybe could use \textbf{bayesian updating} and \textbf{decision theory}

## Top down and bottom-up

- Overall question -> determine field (population) -> potential informants -> actual informants
- but also backloop: actual informants can inform the questions and definition of the field 

## Who is an informant?

- you defined the informant on the variables you think are important -> screening of the field
- however, the variables could be not important (back-loop)
- my case: poverty, educaton, 

## Preserving Anonymity

- what kind of information is data? -> everything is data, but censoring when writing
- informed consent?

## How to recruit people?

- language and cultural skills
- interchangability of informants
- visibility of of potential informants
- gatekeepers and sponsors (identifying, being identified with, snowballing) -> diversity of access points
- negotiating access: 

- do you say you are a researcher/friend -> bias (how do you know you are not a confounder/embedded?)
- do you \textbf{pay}? -> not very common
- pro pay: respect for peoples life, people had costs to get to you
- contra pay: profit, distord the composition of people, when you pay to much
- what to pay: 
- treating averyone the same (pay some and not others?)
- interaction is part of the data-generating process -> its gonna be different (class, ethnic., )
- beyond insider/outsider

# 2. Fieldwork

- you need access and trust
- relationships and identities 
- power dynamics

## record the data

- limits of improvisation/induction-> be explicit about your own biases; who is in the group?
- different age could influence models about accountabilt/civic engagement 
- how you interpete the data depends on how you conceptualize 
- how do you know the story is true:
- collect data that you could check it against; vary the interviewer 
- it's not about that the story is exactly the same, if the persons deliberatly change stories

## Focus Groups-Design



### (1) Interviews

In order to identify some difference in perspectives and to inform the discussion in the focus groups, we will conduct interviews with a sample of the target population. The interview will include the questions:

- What is your experience with poverty?
- What is your definition of poverty?
- Do you fell poor?
- Do you feel you can change the course of your life?
- How would you rate you mental health?
- What is your definition of civic engagement?
- Does poverty undermines your civic engagement?
- Would you like to participate more within your community?


The interviews will recorded on tape. Afterwords it will be transcribed: \url{https://transcribe.wreally.com}


### (2) Pilots: one with poorer and richer groups

- to understands the differences 
- asken open questions, exercises (8 people); write down answers, discuss in pairs, than open discussion; (2 hours); 2 people; tape it;
- starting point: what is social transformation means to the participants (individual change vs. solving big problems)
- make people speack
- iliterate people
- group composition (random?), social hierachy with the group matter (careful)
- discussion part right after 

### (3) Follow up Focus Group

- two weeks after
- have a second focus group after 

### (4) Consent

- do they understand, maybe verbalize consent, th
- make sure they understand and listen to their concerns


# 3. Relationships and Risks in the Field

## Group Work--My Project

### Challanges 1: Logistics

- identify poor population
- hire enumerators--trust needed

### Challanges 2: Present-day accountability challenges

The aim of the focus groups is to ellicite the possibilty of civic engagement in the kenyan context. Put differently, we ask what kind of bottom-up accountabilty channels exist. Their could be substantial barriors for participants to talk freely/openly about these challanges to civic engagement in the context of Kenya because people could fear punishment either from their peers (social sanctioning) or from government officials. This problem calls for the creation of a safe environment and the building of trust prior to the focus groups. One way is to contact local gatekeepers and researchers that have local "standing" and are percieved as impartail and trustworthy. 

We come with pre-conceived ideas of liberal deomcracy and "good life". Is their accountabilty towards not only funders, but also subjects. So we have to decide:

- Level of disclosure about research aims
- Level if variation in presentations
- Level of responsible for securing full understanding
- Insider Outsider


### Ethical Challange 1: Povert Prime/Income Shocks

- there could be also negative consequences from
- 

# Interview Guide (1) - one page or learn questionaire

- use tape-recorder; start open, facts at the end;
- Interview: none, priority, asked, date, recorded, uncorded 
- Key Categories: variation on covariates: education, gender, ethnicity, age
- contact details: nvivo (encrypter)
- geocode

- decision for civic engagement 
- role of civic engagement
- age
- SES
- job
- 

# 5. Coding and Analysis

- how knowledge is produced -- co-production
- Saldana (2009)
- write memo and annotations -> that ensures transparancy
- can we take an observation as a \textbf{social fact}--the respondent has his/her own directionality and inconsistency 
- when decided on the code: 
-
demo()

# 6. Writing

- creating and fullfilling expectations
